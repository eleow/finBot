sealed,"Sealed headphones are also called 'closed-back' headphones and are designed to block out environmental noise using a passive acoustic seal. Full size closed headphones provide about -10dB to -15dB of isolation, mostly in the higher frequencies. Smaller on-ear closed headphones provide somewhat less isolation dependent on their design and the shape of your ear. In-ear headphones are a closed design in which the ear-pieces seal in the ear canal providing about -23dB of outside noise attenuation and are the highest isolation of headphone type. Noise-cancelling headphones are typically sealed designs with battery-powered electronics to attenuate ambient noise better than a passive closed-back seal could provide.",https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary
self-powered speakers,"Usually, computer speakers which contain their own power amplifier, take a line input, and have their own volume control. There are, however, very good self-powered speakers of all sizes and quality used by professionals and audiophiles alike.",https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary

Some headphones come with detachable single-sided cords that allow you to easily store your headphones, switch out the cord with different lengths, or replace damaged cords.",https://www.crutchfield.com/S-P3Fy2Oh1DMm/learn/headphones-glossary.html
solid state,"A broad categorization of active electronic circuitry that use transistors of various types (NPN, PNP, FETs, J-FETs, and analog integrated circuits) to provide gain. Usually used to differentiate between vacuum tube-based designs.",https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary
soundstage,"The ability of an audio system to reproduce the position and sense of space in which the instruments and sound sources are placed. Good imaging is when you can ""see"" with your ears the players standing there.",https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary
speaker,"A device that converts an electrical current into sound. Speakers usually consist of a number of drivers, such as woofers and tweeters, for reproducing a specific range of  frequencies. Most headphones use tiny, scaled-down versions of big speakers to create sound.",https://www.crutchfield.com/S-P3Fy2Oh1DMm/learn/headphones-glossary.html
sport headphones,"Sport-style headphones are specially designed for active use. Most feature earbuds with ear clips, ear loops, or ear hangers for a secure fit, or a behind-the-neck band for an out-of-the-way design. Many also come in bright colors and have a waterproof or sweatproof coating that allows them to be washed by hand.",https://www.crutchfield.com/S-P3Fy2Oh1DMm/learn/headphones-glossary.html
square wave response,An audio test signal which alternates between two D.C. levels. Used to visualize the systems ability to pass a wide range of frequencies in proper time-alignment.,https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary
supra-aural,"Literally meaning ""on the ear,"" supra-aural headphones rest against the outer ear and are generically termed earpad headphones. Ear-pieces are sometimes literally flat pads against the ear, but can also be shallow bowl-shaped, or deeper ear cups that are too small to fully surround the ear.",https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary
swivel earcups,Swivel earcups provide a comfortable fit that better conforms to the shape of an individual's head.

talkthrough button,"Commonly found on noise-canceling headphones, this button turns off the noise-canceling mechanism to let you hear outside noise without removing the headphones. It can be handy when you need to briefly listen to something, such as when the captain makes an announcement on an airplane or when a coworker wants to talk to you.",https://www.crutchfield.com/S-P3Fy2Oh1DMm/learn/headphones-glossary.html
transient response,"The ability of a system to rapidly change voltage and/or acoustic pressure, and settle properly to target voltage/pressure. Also related to high slew rate, and the ability of the system to pass all frequencies at the same rate.",https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary
transistor,A small electronic device which can provide electrical signal gain in circuit construction. Manufactured using silicon or gallium arsenide semiconductor materials in negatively and positively dopes crystal layers in a variety of structural configurations. Mainly segregated into bipolar and field effect types.,https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary
tube amplifier,An audio amplifier using vacuum tubes in its gain stages.,https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary
usb,"USB stands for Universal Serial Bus and is a standardized interface designed primarily for personal computers as a peripheral control interface, but may be used in other devices like gaming consoles and handheld portable devices. The USB standard is controlled by the USB Implementer Forum, Inc which is a consortium of industry players including Apple, HP, NEC, Intel, and Microsoft.",https://www.headphones.com/pages/glossary
virtual surround sound,"Headphones with this feature use sophisticated processing to fool your ears into thinking that sound is coming from multiple locations around you, instead of just two.
